# NVG-TK-GOOGLES
This is a new product of 3d printed night vision googles for airsoft use!, afordable and functional parts

# NVG-TK-GOOGLES science behind them

for this project at first we need to know how to see in dark enviroments with technology, for human eye the wavelength is called visible spectrum wich is the range of wavelengths that human eye can sjee; wich is between 380 and 700 nanometers, for an common night vision googles the wavelenght used is infrared light wich has between 780nm and 1mm so that wavelenght human eye coudnt see.

to overcome the wavelenght problem, digital cameras cam pick up infrared light, but it has a catch, most of the digital cameras from the factory has an filter for infrared light, this filter are mean to increase the overal image quality, but in this project will have some solutions to make it dont be necessary to make any modifications to the digital camera

at first the project have some features based on the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MthrbR4_UAk&t=500s project.

wich uses fpv high resolution on night time video cameras and uses them with an tft with adapter display, those displays are mean to reproduce in real time videos catched by the digital camera

unfortunaly they are quite expensive option still and a bit hard to find them.

problem of this project idea is that they arent using the main feature of the night vision googles, the infrared lighting, but still a functional product, because the fpv camera choosed can cait 0.01 lux lightening of the enviroment.
second problem is that the price of the fpv camera, the final product will be quite expensive by multiplying everything by 4.

# solution 2

after searching for a while, asking about a camera already without ir filter, found some options to use that they are already made for night vision wich makes the overal project with same functionality as intended

this first option is for an usb able, from that what can see can be used as an same as fpv camera and for the tft adpter to use NEEED FOWARD STUFY OF IT
