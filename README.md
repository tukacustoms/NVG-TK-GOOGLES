# NVG-TK-GOOGLES: 3D Printed Night Vision Goggles for Airsoft Enthusiasts

## Introduction

NVG-TK-GOOGLES is an innovative product that brings 3D printed night vision goggles to the airsoft community. These goggles are designed to be both affordable and functional, allowing users to have a clear view in dark environments during airsoft games.

## Science Behind NVG-TK-GOOGLES

Night vision technology relies on the use of infrared light, which falls outside the visible spectrum of the human eye (380 to 700 nanometers). Common night vision goggles utilize infrared light with wavelengths between 780nm and 1mm, making it invisible to the naked eye.

To overcome this limitation, digital cameras capable of detecting infrared light are employed. However, most factory-made digital cameras come with infrared filters that block this light, affecting their night vision capabilities. The NVG-TK-GOOGLES project will address this issue with solutions that avoid the need for modifying the digital cameras.

## Hardware Choices

### Solution 1

Initially, the project considered using high-resolution FPV cameras with TFT displays to achieve real-time video reproduction. While functional, this solution had drawbacks:
- The chosen FPV cameras did not take full advantage of the night vision feature, which is a key aspect of the goggles.
- The expensive cost of the FPV cameras, especially when multiplied by four for panoramic view, made the final product prohibitively expensive.

### Solution 2

The project shifted its focus to digital cameras with factory-installed infrared filters removed to fully utilize the IR sensitivity for night vision. After extensive research, three viable options were found:

#### Camera Option 1
